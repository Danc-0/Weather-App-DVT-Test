# Weather-App-DVT-Test
This is a Android Interview Test for DVT.

It's a Weather App to display the current weather at the userâ€™s location and a 5-day forecast.

### Requirements

Weather forecast must be based on the userâ€™s current location.

The background image changes depending on the type of weather (Cloudy, Sunny and Rainy).

Saving different weather locations as favourites

Ability to view a list of favourites

Getting extra information about a specific location

Using GOOGLE PLACES API [Places](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)

Offline capability and show time the app or weather were last updated.

Users ability to view saved locations on a map

Users ability to access a map and see all the weather locations they have saved as favourites and also where they are now.

## Tech Stack
The Architecture Components and Libraries am using in the Development of the whole Application.
* Architecture
  * MVVM -- Application Level
  * Android Architecture Components

* Stack
  * [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)ðŸš€ - Libraries that help follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices so that developers can focus on the code they care about.
  * [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - For dependency injection
  * [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Support library that allows binding of UI components in layouts to data sources,binds character details and search results to UI.
  * [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)
  * [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?gclid=CjwKCAjwk_WVBhBZEiwAUHQCmdx8rjojm7dxpQ2EGOYQydzDN3DbqnzZBC0nq-GGzvdmCvnnFYvgFRoCyPEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - Is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
  * [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
  * [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Provide an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite
  * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Class through which API Interfaces turn callable objects
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel?gclid=CjwKCAjwjJmIBhA4EiwAQdCbxrvUiq3wgakPX8sop8Kp8irusL4bi_9xCnaiZkUJqBzTbOTB2FB4XRoCujoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - Manage UI related data in a lifecycle conscious way and act as a channel between use cases and ui
